My dream curriculum for the sophomore year of high school would emphasize critical thinking, empathy, and hands-on problem solving. The focus would be more toward looking in-depth at problems/events and understanding them from multiple perspectives rather than glossing over too many problems/events without ever gaining a deep understanding.


Dramatic Arts: story - play - performance studies - empathy

Media Studies: media creation - propaganda - marketing - curation

History: competing histories from different perspectives - specific examples in depth from multiple angles
In the documentary film about the Vietnam War, "Fog of War", former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert MacNamera states "In the case of Vietnam, we didn't know them well enough to empathize. And there was total misunderstanding as a result. They believed that we had simply replaced the French as a colonial power, and we were seeking to subject South and North Vietnam to our colonial interests, which was absolutely absurd. And we, we saw Vietnam as an element of the Cold War. Not what they saw it as: a civil war."

Engineering: geometry - physics - architecture - problem-solving sessions - teamwork

Fine Arts: visual art - music - sculpture - both traditional and computer enhanced, mixed media creations and collaborations

Life Sciences: ecology/ecosystems - biology - chemistry - health - anatomy/systems - caring for and raising animals and plants
